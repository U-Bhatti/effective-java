    <h1 style="cursor: default;" title="">Item 44: Favor the use of standard functional interfaces</h1>

    <p style="cursor: default;" title="">Now that Java has lambdas, best practices for writing APIs have changed
        considerably. For example, the
        Template Method pattern <span>[Gamma95]</span>, wherein a subclass overrides a primitive method to
        specialize the behavior of its superclass, is far less attractive. The modern alternative is to provide
        a
        static factory or constructor that accepts a function object to achieve the same effect. More generally,
        you’ll be writing more constructors and methods that take function objects as parameters. Choosing the
        right
        functional parameter type demands care.</p>

    <p style="cursor: default;" title="">Consider <code>LinkedHashMap</code>. You can use this class as a cache
        by
        overriding its protected
        <code>removeEldestEntry</code> method, which is invoked by <code>put</code> each time a new key is added
        to
        the map. When this method returns true, the map removes its eldest entry, which is passed to the method.
        The
        following override allows the map to grow to one hundred entries and then deletes the eldest entry each
        time
        a new key is added, maintaining the hundred most recent entries:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-java hljs">    <span class="hljs-keyword">protected</span> <span class="hljs-type">boolean</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">removeEldestEntry</span><span class="hljs-params">(Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt; eldest)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> size() &gt; <span class="hljs-number">100</span>;
    }</code></pre>

    <p>This technique works fine, but you can do much better with lambdas. If <code>LinkedHashMap</code> were
        written today, it would have a static factory or constructor that took a function object. Looking at the
        declaration for <code>removeEldestEntry</code>, you might think that the function object should take a
        <code>Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;</code> and return a boolean, but that wouldn’t quite do it: The
        <code>removeEldestEntry</code> method calls <code>size()</code> to get the number of entries in the map,
        which works because <code>removeEldestEntry</code> is an instance method on the map. The function object
        that you pass to the constructor is not an instance method on the map and can’t capture it because the
        map
        doesn’t exist yet when its factory or constructor is invoked. Thus, the map must pass itself to the
        function
        object, which must therefore take the map on input as well as its eldest entry. If you were to declare
        such
        a functional interface, it would look something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-java hljs">    <span class="hljs-comment">// Unnecessary functional interface; use a standard one instead.</span>
    <span class="hljs-meta">@FunctionalInterface</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">EldestEntryRemovalFunction</span>&lt;K,V&gt;{
        <span class="hljs-type">boolean</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">remove</span><span class="hljs-params">(Map&lt;K,V&gt; map, Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt; eldest)</span>;
    }     </code></pre>

    <p>This interface would work fine, but you shouldn’t use it, because you don’t need to declare a new
        interface
        for this purpose. The <code>java.util.function</code> package provides a large collection of standard
        functional interfaces for your use.</p>

    <p>If one of the standard functional interfaces does the job, you should generally use it in preference to a
        purpose-built functional interface. This will make your API easier to learn, by reducing its conceptual
        surface area, and will provide significant interoperability benefits, as many of the standard functional
        interfaces provide useful default methods. The <code>Predicate</code> interface, for instance, provides
        methods to combine predicates. In the case of our <code>LinkedHashMap</code> example, the standard
        <code>BiPredicate&lt;Map&lt;K,V&gt;, Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;</code> interface should be used in
        preference
        to a custom <code>EldestEntryRemovalFunction</code> interface.
    </p>

    <p>There are forty-three interfaces in <code>java.util.function</code>. You can’t be expected to remember
        them
        all, but if you remember six basic interfaces, you can derive the rest when you need them. The basic
        interfaces operate on object reference types. The <code>Operator</code> interfaces represent functions
        whose
        result and argument types are the same. The <code>Predicate</code> interface represents a function that
        takes an argument and returns a boolean. The <code>Function</code> interface represents a function whose
        argument and return types differ. The <code>Supplier</code> interface represents a function that takes
        no
        arguments and returns (or “supplies”) a value. Finally, <code>Consumer</code> represents a function that
        takes an argument and returns nothing, essentially consuming its argument. The six basic functional
        interfaces are summarized below:</p>

    <p>There are also three variants of each of the six basic interfaces to operate on the primitive types
        <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, and <code>double</code>. Their names are derived from the basic
        interfaces by prefixing them with a primitive type. So, for example, a predicate that takes an
        <code>int</code> is an <code>IntPredicate</code>, and a binary operator that takes two <code>long</code>
        values and returns a <code>long</code> is a <code>LongBinaryOperator</code>. None of these variant types
        is
        parameterized except for the <code>Function</code> variants, which are parameterized by return type. For
        example, <code>LongFunction&lt;int[]&gt;</code> takes a <code>long</code> and returns an
        <code>int[]</code>.

        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>There are nine additional variants of the <code>Function</code> interface, for use when the result type
        is
        primitive. The source and result types always differ, because a function from a type to itself is a
        <code>UnaryOperator</code>. If both the source and result types are primitive, prefix
        <code>Function</code>
        with <code>SrcToResult</code>, for example <code>LongToIntFunction</code> (six variants). If the source
        is a
        primitive and the result is an object reference, prefix <code>Function</code> with
        <code>&lt;Src&gt;ToObj</code>, for example <code>DoubleToObjFunction</code> (three variants).
    </p>

    <p>There are two-argument versions of the three basic functional interfaces for which it makes sense to have
        them: <code>BiPredicate&lt;T,U&gt;</code>, <code>BiFunction&lt;T,U,R&gt;</code>, and
        <code>BiConsumer&lt;T,U&gt;</code>. There are also <code>BiFunction</code> variants returning the three
        relevant primitive types: <code>ToIntBiFunction&lt;T,U&gt;</code>,
        <code>ToLongBiFunction&lt;T,U&gt;</code>,
        and <code>ToDoubleBiFunction&lt;T,U&gt;</code>. There are two-argument variants of <code>Consumer</code>
        that take one object reference and one primitive type: <code>ObjDoubleConsumer&lt;T&gt;</code>,
        <code>ObjIntConsumer&lt;T&gt;</code>, and <code>ObjLongConsumer&lt;T&gt;</code>. In total, there are
        nine
        two-argument versions of the basic interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>Finally, there is the <code>BooleanSupplier</code> interface, a variant of <code>Supplier</code> that
        returns
        boolean values. This is the only explicit mention of the boolean type in any of the standard functional
        interface names, but boolean return values are supported via <code>Predicate</code> and its four variant
        forms. The <code>BooleanSupplier</code> interface and the forty-two interfaces described in the previous
        paragraphs account for all forty-three standard functional interfaces. Admittedly, this is a lot to
        swallow,
        and not terribly orthogonal. On the other hand, the bulk of the functional interfaces that you’ll need
        have
        been written for you and their names are regular enough that you shouldn’t have too much trouble coming
        up
        with one when you need it.</p>

    <p>Most of the standard functional interfaces exist only to provide support for primitive types. Don’t be
        tempted to use basic functional interfaces with boxed primitives instead of primitive functional
        interfaces.
        While it works, it violates the advice of Item 61, “prefer primitive types to boxed primitives.” The
        performance consequences of using boxed primitives for bulk operations can be deadly.</p>

    <p>Now you know that you should typically use standard functional interfaces in preference to writing your
        own.
        But when should you write your own? Of course you need to write your own if none of the standard ones
        does
        what you need, for example if you require a predicate that takes three parameters, or one that throws a
        checked exception. But there are times you should write your own functional interface even when one of
        the
        standard ones is structurally identical.</p>

    <p>Consider our old friend <code>Comparator&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is structurally identical to the
        <code>ToIntBiFunction&lt;T,T&gt;</code> interface. Even if the latter interface had existed when the
        former
        was added to the libraries, it would have been wrong to use it. There are several reasons that
        <code>Comparator</code> deserves its own interface. First, its name provides excellent documentation
        every
        time it is used in an API, and it’s used a lot. Second, the <code>Comparator</code> interface has strong
        requirements on what constitutes a valid instance, which comprise its general contract. By implementing
        the
        interface, you are pledging to adhere to its contract. Third, the interface is heavily outfitted with
        useful
        default methods to transform and combine comparators.
    </p>

    <p>You should seriously consider writing a purpose-built functional interface in preference to using a
        standard
        one if you need a functional interface that shares one or more of the following characteristics with
        <code>Comparator</code>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It will be commonly used and could benefit from a descriptive name.</li>
        <li>It has a strong contract associated with it.</li>
        <li>It would benefit from custom default methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you elect to write your own functional interface, remember that it’s an interface and hence should be
        designed with great care (Item 21).</p>

    <p>Notice that the <code>EldestEntryRemovalFunction</code> interface (page 199) is labeled with the
        <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> annotation. This annotation type is similar in spirit to
        <code>@Override</code>. It is a statement of programmer intent that serves three purposes: it tells
        readers
        of the class and its documentation that the interface was designed to enable lambdas; it keeps you
        honest
        because the interface won’t compile unless it has exactly one abstract method; and it prevents
        maintainers
        from accidentally adding abstract methods to the interface as it evolves. Always annotate your
        functional
        interfaces with the <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> annotation.
    </p>

    <p>A final point should be made concerning the use of functional interfaces in APIs. Do not provide a method
        with multiple overloadings that take different functional interfaces in the same argument position if it
        could create a possible ambiguity in the client. This is not just a theoretical problem. The
        <code>submit</code> method of <code>ExecutorService</code> can take either a
        <code>Callable&lt;T&gt;</code>
        or a <code>Runnable</code>, and it is possible to write a client program that requires a cast to
        indicate
        the correct overloading (Item 52). The easiest way to avoid this problem is not to write overloadings
        that
        take different functional interfaces in the same argument position. This is a special case of the advice
        in
        Item 52, “use overloading judiciously.”
    </p>

    <p>In summary, now that Java has lambdas, it is imperative that you design your APIs with lambdas in mind.
        Accept functional interface types on input and return them on output. It is generally best to use the
        standard interfaces provided in <code>java.util.function</code>, but keep your eyes open for the
        relatively
        rare cases where you would be better off writing your own functional interface.</p>
